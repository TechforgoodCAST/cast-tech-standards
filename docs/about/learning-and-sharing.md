# Learning and sharing

We strive to uphold our *[guiding principles](./guiding-principles)* and **be humble** in the way we learn and share. Meaning we acknowledge that we might be experts in certain areas and novices in others.

This approach allows us to foster an environment of continual learning and sharing of knowledge amongst our team and with the wider tech for good movement.
